- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Adam.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in embedded systems, iOS dev, IoT, and Hauptwerk.
- ğŸ¥³ Outside of tech, I am a professional musician (piano and organ) and enjoy photography, Jeeping, and my dog.
- ğŸ‘¾ I'm comfortable in Swift, C/C++, Python, Java, and git.
- ğŸ¤” Maybe I should use Github more than local git.
- ğŸŒ± Learning is fun, and I'm working my way through The Odin Project.
